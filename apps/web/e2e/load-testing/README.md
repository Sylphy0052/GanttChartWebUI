### Configuration

The load testing suite uses specialized Playwright configurations:

- **load-testing**: General load testing with extended timeouts
- **concurrency-testing**: Isolated environment for concurrent user testing
- **memory-leak-testing**: Chromium with memory API enabled for leak detection

### Browser Configuration for Memory Testing

Memory leak detection requires Chrome with specific flags:
- `--enable-precise-memory-info`
- `--js-flags=--expose-gc`
- `--disable-background-timer-throttling`

## Best Practices

### Test Execution
1. Run load tests in isolated environments
2. Ensure consistent network conditions
3. Use dedicated test data (not production)
4. Monitor system resources during execution
5. Run tests at consistent times for trend analysis

### Performance Analysis
1. Establish baseline measurements
2. Track performance trends over time
3. Focus on user-critical operations first
4. Consider 95th percentile metrics, not just averages
5. Validate fixes with before/after comparisons

### Continuous Integration
1. Include load tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. Set up performance regression alerts
3. Automate report generation and distribution
4. Track performance metrics as code quality indicators

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory tests failing on non-Chromium browsers**
- Memory API is only available in Chromium
- Tests automatically skip on other browsers

**Timeout issues with large datasets**
- Increase timeout values in playwright.config.ts
- Consider reducing dataset size for faster iteration
- Check network connectivity and API response times

**Concurrent user tests failing**
- Verify system can handle the target load
- Check for rate limiting or connection limits
- Monitor server resources during testing

**Inconsistent performance results**
- Ensure consistent test environment
- Run tests multiple times for statistical significance
- Consider external factors (network, system load)

### Performance Optimization Tips

**Frontend Optimization**
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- Optimize bundle size and loading strategies
- Implement proper code splitting

**Backend Optimization**
- Add database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize API response payloads
- Use connection pooling effectively

**System-Level Optimization**
- Monitor and optimize memory usage patterns
- Implement proper garbage collection strategies
- Use CDN for static asset delivery
- Configure proper server resource allocation

## Contributing

When adding new load tests:

1. Follow the established naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive logging and metrics collection
3. Add appropriate performance benchmarks
4. Document expected performance targets
5. Include both positive and negative test cases
6. Ensure proper cleanup after test execution
