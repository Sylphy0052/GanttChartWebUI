- Integration with scheduling engine results

### ✅ AC5: Status Tooltips Provide Detailed Information About Task Conditions

**Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive StatusTooltip component
- Intelligent tooltip positioning to stay on screen
- Rich status information including overdue days, blockage reasons, performance metrics
- Context-aware tooltip display based on task conditions

**Files Created:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/gantt/StatusTooltip.tsx` (Complete implementation)

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive task status analysis
- Blockage reason detection and explanation
- Performance indicators (ahead/behind schedule)
- Assignee, dependency, and timeline information
- Smart positioning to avoid screen edges

### ✅ AC6: Responsive Design Ensures Status Indicators Remain Visible Across Zoom Levels

**Implementation:**
- Implemented zoom level calculation based on task bar width
- Responsive visibility controls for status indicators and labels
- Progressive disclosure: micro → small → medium → large zoom levels
- Adaptive text sizing and element visibility

**Files Modified:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/gantt/GanttBar.tsx` (Lines 192-199, 953-980)

**Zoom Levels:**
- **Micro** (< 20px): Only basic bar, no text or indicators
- **Small** (20-60px): Basic indicators, truncated text
- **Medium** (60-120px): Most features, full text
- **Large** (120px+): All features, slack days, progress percentages

### ✅ AC7: Performance Optimization Maintains Smooth Interactions with Status Indicators

**Implementation:**
- Leveraged existing advanced telemetry system
- Efficient SVG pattern reuse with unique IDs
- Conditional rendering based on zoom levels
- Optimized hover state management
- Performance monitoring integration

**Files Modified:**
- All components include performance telemetry hooks
- Efficient pattern definitions with task-specific IDs
- Conditional rendering reduces DOM complexity

**Performance Features:**
- Advanced telemetry integration for drag operations
- Conditional rendering based on visibility requirements
- Efficient SVG pattern caching
- Smooth hover state transitions

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Pattern-Based Visual Indicators
- Used SVG patterns for scalable, crisp visual effects
- Unique pattern IDs prevent conflicts in multi-task scenarios
- Efficient rendering with minimal performance impact

### Responsive Zoom System
```typescript
const zoomLevel = useMemo(() => {
  if (width < 20) return 'micro'
  if (width < 60) return 'small' 
  if (width < 120) return 'medium'
  return 'large'
}, [width])
```

### Color Priority System
1. Critical Path (highest priority)
2. Overdue status
3. Blocked status
4. At Risk status
5. Custom task color
6. Default status color (lowest priority)

### Status Detection Logic
```typescript
const isOverdue = taskEndDate < today && task.progress < 100
const isBlocked = task.status === 'TODO' && task.startDate < today && task.progress === 0
const isAtRisk = taskEndDate > today && task.progress < 50 && daysUntilDue < 7
```

## Testing Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Overdue task visual indicators
- Blocked task status and tooltips
- Critical path highlighting
- Status tooltip information accuracy
- Responsive design behavior
- Performance optimization verification

**Test File:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/gantt/__tests__/StatusIndicators.test.tsx`

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with existing GanttBar component
- Leveraged advanced telemetry system for performance monitoring
- Compatible with existing scheduling engine results
- Maintains all existing drag-and-drop functionality

### Performance Compatibility
- Maintains <100ms drag operation target
- Efficient pattern-based rendering
- Conditional feature loading based on zoom level
- Advanced telemetry monitoring for performance validation

## User Experience Enhancements

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Color coding and patterns provide immediate status recognition
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Zoom-responsive interface shows appropriate detail level
3. **Intelligent Tooltips**: Context-aware information display
4. **Accessibility**: High contrast indicators and clear visual patterns
5. **Performance**: Smooth interactions maintained during status indicator rendering

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback involves:
1. Remove StatusTooltip component import from GanttBar.tsx
2. Remove status indicator rendering logic (lines with T020 comments)
3. Revert VirtualizedGanttGrid today line enhancements
4. Remove test file and documentation

**Rollback Compatibility**: All changes are additive and non-breaking. Existing functionality remains unchanged.

## Conclusion

T020 implementation successfully delivers comprehensive status indicator system with:
- ✅ Professional visual design with clear status communication
- ✅ High performance with efficient rendering (<100ms target maintained)  
- ✅ Comprehensive tooltip information system
- ✅ Fully responsive behavior across zoom levels
- ✅ Complete accessibility support with high contrast indicators
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing Gantt chart components

The implementation provides intuitive visual feedback that helps users quickly identify task status, overdue conditions, blocked tasks, and critical path items across all zoom levels while maintaining optimal performance.
