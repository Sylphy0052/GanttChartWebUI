## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Command Pattern System** (`/lib/commands/`)
   - `BaseCommand.ts` - Abstract base with common functionality
   - `CompositeCommand.ts` - Multi-operation commands
   - `BarOperationCommand.ts` - Bar move/resize/progress commands
   - `DependencyCommand.ts` - Dependency create/delete commands
   - `IssueEditCommand.ts` - Issue editing commands
   - `AutoSchedulingCommand.ts` - Intelligent scheduling commands

2. **Centralized Undo/Redo Hook** (`useUndoRedo.tsx`)
   - History stack management (AC6)
   - Telemetry integration (AC7)
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Y, Cmd+Z/Shift+Z)
   - Memory management and cleanup
   - Performance monitoring integration

3. **Domain-Specific Hooks**
   - `useIssueWithUndo.tsx` - Issue operations with undo
   - `useDependenciesWithUndo.tsx` - Dependency operations with undo
   - Integration with existing base hooks

4. **Telemetry & Audit System**
   - `audit-logs.ts` API client
   - Comprehensive metrics collection
   - Batched sending for performance
   - Error tracking and recovery

### Key Technical Features

**AC6 - History Stack Management:**
- Configurable max size (default: 20)
- Automatic truncation with FIFO behavior
- Smart memory cleanup preserving relevant commands
- Session state management
- Stack overflow protection

**AC7 - Telemetry Integration:**
- Operation tracking: execute/undo/redo for all command types
- Performance metrics: execution time, memory usage, render time
- Session metrics: command counts, stack size, success rates
- Error tracking: full error details, stack traces, recovery data
- Audit logs API integration with fallback handling
- Privacy-aware logging (development vs production)

---

## Testing & Verification

### AC6 Tests
- ✅ Max 20 items limit enforcement
- ✅ History truncation behavior
- ✅ Memory cleanup functionality
- ✅ Stack overflow handling
- ✅ Complex operation scenarios

### AC7 Tests  
- ✅ Execute operation telemetry
- ✅ Undo operation telemetry
- ✅ Redo operation telemetry
- ✅ Error telemetry tracking
- ✅ Batch flush behavior
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics collection
- ✅ API integration handling

### Integration Tests
- ✅ AC6 + AC7 combined functionality
- ✅ Telemetry accuracy during stack truncation
- ✅ All command types working with undo/redo
- ✅ Auto-scheduling integration

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Undo/Redo
```typescript
const undoRedo = useUndoRedo({
  maxHistorySize: 20,        // AC6: Max 20 items
  telemetryEnabled: true,    // AC7: Full telemetry
  projectId: 'project-123'   // AC7: Audit logs integration
})

// Execute commands with automatic history management
await undoRedo.executeCommand(new BarMoveCommand(...))
await undoRedo.undo() // AC6: Stack managed, AC7: Telemetry sent
await undoRedo.redo() // AC6: Stack managed, AC7: Telemetry sent
```

### Issue Editing with Undo
```typescript
const issueOps = useIssueWithUndo({
  projectId: 'project-123',  // AC7: Telemetry integration
  autoSaveEnabled: true
})

// All operations support undo/redo with telemetry
await issueOps.updateIssue(id, updates)
await issueOps.undo() // AC3: Issue undo, AC7: Telemetry
```

### Auto-Scheduling with Undo
```typescript
// AC4 + AC5: Auto-scheduling with full undo support
const autoScheduleCommand = new AutoSchedulingCommand({
  primaryCommand: barMoveCommand,
  tasks, dependencies,
  onTaskUpdate: updateHandler
})

await undoRedo.executeCommand(autoScheduleCommand)
await undoRedo.undo() // AC5: All auto-adjustments undone
```

## Performance & Memory Management

### AC6 - Memory Efficiency
- History limited to 20 commands maximum
- Periodic cleanup (60 second intervals)  
- Smart command filtering (keeps relevant commands)
- Automatic truncation on stack overflow

### AC7 - Telemetry Performance
- Batched sending (5 operations per batch)
- Asynchronous API calls with error handling
- Development vs production logging
- Memory-efficient metrics collection

---

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- ✅ Gantt chart operations (bars, dependencies)
- ✅ Issue management system
- ✅ Performance monitoring system
- ✅ Audit logs API
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts

### Future Extensibility  
- Command pattern supports new operation types
- Telemetry system extensible for new metrics
- History management configurable per use case
- API integration supports additional endpoints

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate**: Disable telemetry via `telemetryEnabled: false`
2. **Short-term**: Reduce history size via `maxHistorySize`
3. **Full rollback**: All new files are isolated and can be removed without affecting core functionality

**Rollback files**:
- `/hooks/useUndoRedo.tsx`
- `/hooks/useIssueWithUndo.tsx` 
- `/hooks/useDependenciesWithUndo.tsx`
- `/lib/commands/*` (all command implementations)
- Test files in `__tests__` directories

---

## Conclusion

**T010 - Undo/Redo・依存自動調整システム** is **COMPLETE** with all 7 acceptance criteria implemented and verified:

- **AC1-AC5**: Comprehensive undo/redo for all operations ✅
- **AC6**: History stack management (max 20) with memory cleanup ✅  
- **AC7**: Full telemetry integration with audit logs API ✅

The system provides enterprise-grade undo/redo functionality with intelligent memory management and comprehensive telemetry, ready for Sprint 2 integration and production deployment.
