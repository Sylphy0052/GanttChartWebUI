│   └── 2.3 Design Review
└── 3. Development Phase
    ├── 3.1 Frontend Development
    ├── 3.2 Backend Development
    └── 3.3 Testing & QA
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Parent Tasks:** High-level project phases
- **Child Tasks:** Detailed work items within phases

#### **2.2 Creating Tasks with Drag & Drop (2 minutes)**
```
✏️ Task Creation Steps:
1. Click "Add Task" button or press "+" key
2. Enter task details:
   ✓ Task Name: "Requirements Gathering"
   ✓ Description: Detailed task description

   ✓ Assignee: Choose team member
   ✓ Progress: 0% (will update as work progresses)

3. Drag and drop to organize hierarchy:

   - Reorder tasks by dragging up/down
   - Create dependencies between tasks
```

**✅ Interactive Exercise:**
