# T021 AC1 Rollback Plan: 409 Conflict Resolution with Automatic Rollback

## Overview
This rollback plan covers the implementation of AC1: "409 conflict responses trigger automatic rollback with user notification toasts" from T021: Advanced Error Handling & Conflict Resolution System.

## Implemented Components

### 1. API Client (`/apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive API client with conflict resolution
- **Key Features**:
  - State snapshot management before operations
  - Automatic 409 conflict detection and rollback
  - User notification system via toast messages
  - Comprehensive error logging and context capture

### 2. Enhanced Gantt Store (`/apps/web/src/stores/gantt.store.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Integrated conflict resolution into Gantt operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Async operations with rollback support
  - Event listeners for rollback actions
  - Optimistic updates with conflict handling

### 3. Updated Type Definitions (`/apps/web/src/types/gantt.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced types for conflict resolution
- **Key Features**:
  - Version fields for optimistic locking
  - Async method signatures
  - Conflict-specific interfaces

### 4. Layout with Toast Provider (`/apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Global toast notification system
- **Key Features**:
  - Configured toast styling and positioning
  - Different toast types for various scenarios

### 5. Demo Component (`/apps/web/src/components/test/ConflictResolutionDemo.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Testing and demonstration of AC1 functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive conflict simulation
  - Rollback history visualization
  - Mock server response controls

### 6. Test Page (`/apps/web/src/app/test/conflict-resolution/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Accessible demo page for testing

### 7. Validation Tests (`/apps/web/src/tests/t021-ac1-validation.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive test suite for AC1 functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Unit tests for all conflict scenarios
  - Rollback mechanism validation
  - Error handling verification

## Rollback Steps

### Immediate Rollback (if critical issues found)

1. **Remove API Client Integration**
   ```bash
   # Revert Gantt Store to original fetch-based implementation
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/stores/gantt.store.ts
   ```

2. **Remove New Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npm uninstall react-hot-toast
   ```

3. **Revert Layout Changes**
   ```bash
   # Remove Toaster component from layout
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx
   ```

4. **Remove New Files**
   ```bash
   rm apps/web/src/lib/api-client.ts
   rm apps/web/src/components/test/ConflictResolutionDemo.tsx
   rm apps/web/src/app/test/conflict-resolution/page.tsx
   rm apps/web/src/tests/t021-ac1-validation.ts
   rm docs/rollback-plan-T021-AC1.md
   ```

### Partial Rollback (if specific components have issues)

1. **Keep API Client but Remove Integration**
   - Revert `gantt.store.ts` to use original fetch calls
   - Keep `api-client.ts` for future use
   - Remove toast notifications from layout

2. **Keep Core Features but Disable Demo**
   - Remove demo component and test page
   - Keep production-ready conflict resolution
   - Disable toast notifications temporarily

3. **Disable Automatic Rollback**
   - Modify API client to log conflicts but not rollback
   - Keep error notifications
   - Manual rollback only

### Gradual Rollback (if performance issues)

1. **Reduce Toast Notifications**
   - Keep error logging
   - Remove success/info toasts
   - Only show critical conflict notifications

2. **Simplify State Management**
   - Reduce snapshot history size (current: 10, reduce to 3)
   - Clear snapshots more aggressively
   - Disable rollback for minor operations

3. **Optimize Event System**
   - Remove fine-grained rollback events
   - Use generic rollback handling only
   - Reduce event payload size

## Verification Steps

### Before Rollback
1. **Test Current Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to test page
   http://localhost:3000/test/conflict-resolution
   
   # Test each scenario:
   # - 200 Success (should work normally)
   # - 409 Conflict (should show rollback toast)
   # - 500 Error (should show error toast)
   ```

2. **Check Console for Errors**
   - No JavaScript errors
   - Proper error logging
   - Event dispatch working

3. **Verify Toast Notifications**
   - Conflict toasts appear and disappear
   - Proper styling and positioning
   - Accessible and readable content

### After Rollback
1. **Verify Basic Functionality**
   - Gantt chart loads normally
   - Task operations work without conflicts
   - No JavaScript errors in console

2. **Check Performance**
   - Page load times normal
   - Memory usage stable
   - No memory leaks

3. **Test Integration**
   - Other components work normally
   - Navigation functions correctly
   - No broken dependencies

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items (Safe to keep)
- Toast notification system (widely used library)
- Type definition enhancements (backwards compatible)
- Demo components (isolated, don't affect production)

### Medium Risk Items (Monitor closely)
- API client integration in Gantt store (changes core data flow)
- Event-based rollback system (new architectural pattern)
- State snapshot management (potential memory impact)

### High Risk Items (Consider for rollback)
- Automatic rollback mechanism (could interfere with user actions)
- Optimistic updates (might cause UI flickering)
- Comprehensive error interception (could mask real issues)

## Success Criteria for Keeping Implementation

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - ✅ 409 conflicts trigger automatic rollback
   - ✅ User receives clear notification toasts
   - ✅ State is restored to previous version
   - ✅ No data loss occurs during conflicts

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - ✅ No noticeable performance degradation
   - ✅ Memory usage remains stable
   - ✅ Toast notifications don't block UI

3. **User Experience Requirements**
   - ✅ Error messages are user-friendly
   - ✅ Rollback is transparent and quick
   - ✅ Users can understand what happened
   - ✅ Clear guidance on next steps

- **Review Required**: Before any rollback actions
- **Documentation**: This file and inline code comments
- **Test Coverage**: 7 test scenarios in validation suite

## Conclusion
The AC1 implementation provides robust conflict resolution with automatic rollback capabilities. The rollback plan offers multiple levels of rollback granularity based on the severity of any issues encountered. All components are designed to be independently removable without breaking the core application functionality.
