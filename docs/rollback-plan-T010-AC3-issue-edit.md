# Rollback Plan: T010_AC3 Issue Edit Undo/Redo

**Date:** 2024-09-06  
**Implementation:** T010_AC3 - Issue編集（詳細パネル）のUndo/Redoが動作する  
**Risk Level:** LOW - Non-breaking addition with fallback patterns

## Overview

This rollback plan covers the implementation of Issue editing with undo/redo functionality (T010_AC3). The implementation is additive and includes fallback patterns, making rollback straightforward if issues arise.

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files Created
```
apps/web/src/lib/commands/IssueEditCommand.ts
apps/web/src/hooks/useIssueWithUndo.tsx
apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueDetailPanelWithUndo.tsx
apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueEditDemo.tsx
apps/web/src/lib/commands/__tests__/IssueEditCommand.test.ts
docs/rollback-plan-T010-AC3-issue-edit.md
```

### Existing Files Modified
- **None** - This implementation is purely additive

## Rollback Scenarios & Actions

### Scenario 1: Component Loading Issues
**Symptoms:** IssueDetailPanelWithUndo fails to load or crashes
**Risk:** LOW
**Action:**
```bash
# Remove the new component and fall back to original
rm apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueDetailPanelWithUndo.tsx
rm apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueEditDemo.tsx

# Update imports to use original IssueDetailPanel
# (Manual step - update any references to use original component)
```

### Scenario 2: Command Pattern Issues
**Symptoms:** IssueEditCommand execution errors, memory leaks
**Risk:** LOW
**Action:**
```bash
# Remove the command implementation
rm apps/web/src/lib/commands/IssueEditCommand.ts

# Remove the hook that depends on it
rm apps/web/src/hooks/useIssueWithUndo.tsx

# The original issue editing will continue to work normally
```

### Scenario 3: Hook Integration Problems
**Symptoms:** useIssueWithUndo causes crashes or infinite loops
**Risk:** LOW
**Action:**
```bash
# Remove the hook
rm apps/web/src/hooks/useIssueWithUndo.tsx

# Components can fall back to direct store usage
# Original IssueDetailPanel remains unaffected
```

### Scenario 4: Performance Issues
**Symptoms:** Slow issue editing, high memory usage, browser freezing
**Risk:** LOW
**Action:**
1. Disable undo/redo by not using the new components
2. Fall back to original IssueDetailPanel
3. Monitor performance metrics

### Scenario 5: Complete Rollback
**Symptoms:** Multiple issues, need to remove entire feature
**Risk:** LOW
**Action:**
```bash
# Complete rollback script
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/lib/commands/IssueEditCommand.ts
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/hooks/useIssueWithUndo.tsx  
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueDetailPanelWithUndo.tsx
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueEditDemo.tsx
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/lib/commands/__tests__/IssueEditCommand.test.ts

# Remove the files
rm apps/web/src/lib/commands/IssueEditCommand.ts
rm apps/web/src/hooks/useIssueWithUndo.tsx
rm apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueDetailPanelWithUndo.tsx  
rm apps/web/src/components/issues/IssueEditDemo.tsx
rm apps/web/src/lib/commands/__tests__/IssueEditCommand.test.ts

# Commit the rollback
git add -A
git commit -m "rollback: Remove T010_AC3 Issue edit undo/redo implementation"
```

## Data Safety

### No Data Loss Risk
- **Issue Store:** Original issue store remains unchanged
- **API Calls:** Uses existing updateIssue API, no new endpoints
- **User Data:** All changes go through existing validation
- **Database:** No schema changes, existing issue update flow preserved

### Validation Preserved  
- Form validation logic matches existing patterns
- API validation remains in place
- No bypass of existing security measures

## Component Compatibility

### Backward Compatible
- Original `IssueDetailPanel` remains unchanged and functional
- New components are additive, not replacing existing ones
- Existing issue editing workflows unaffected

### Forward Compatible
- New command pattern integrates with existing undo/redo system
- Hook pattern allows future extensions
- No breaking changes to existing components

## Testing Rollback

### Pre-Rollback Checklist
- [ ] Verify original IssueDetailPanel still works
- [ ] Check issue store functions normally
- [ ] Confirm existing API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Test basic issue CRUD operations

### Post-Rollback Verification
- [ ] Issue detail panel opens and displays correctly
- [ ] Issue editing saves changes properly
- [ ] No console errors or memory leaks
- [ ] Form validation works as expected
- [ ] API calls complete successfully

## Monitoring Points

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Browser Memory Usage:** Monitor for memory leaks from command history
- **API Response Times:** Ensure no performance degradation
- **Error Rates:** Watch for increased JavaScript errors
- **User Experience:** Monitor edit form responsiveness

### Alert Triggers
- Memory usage > 100MB increase
- API errors > 5% increase  
- JavaScript errors > 10% increase
- Form submission time > 2s

## Recovery Time

### Expected Rollback Time
- **Simple Issues:** 5-10 minutes (disable new components)
- **Complex Issues:** 15-30 minutes (complete file removal)
- **Emergency:** 2-5 minutes (git revert)

### Zero Downtime
All rollback actions can be performed without service interruption since:
- New components are opt-in, not default
- Original functionality remains intact
- No database migrations required
- No API changes deployed

## Stakeholder Communication

### Internal Team
- Engineering team notified of rollback initiation
- QA team updated on testing requirements
- Product team informed of feature availability

### User Impact
- **Minimal:** Users continue using existing issue editing
- **No Data Loss:** All existing workflows preserved
- **No Downtime:** Service remains available throughout rollback

## Prevention Measures

### For Future Implementations
1. **Gradual Rollout:** Feature flags for undo/redo components
2. **A/B Testing:** Compare old vs new component performance
3. **Monitoring:** Enhanced metrics for new command pattern usage
4. **Fallback UI:** Graceful degradation when undo system fails

### Code Quality
1. **Error Boundaries:** Wrap new components to prevent crashes
2. **Memory Management:** Automatic cleanup in useEffect hooks
3. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive field validation before API calls
4. **Performance:** Debouncing for auto-save, efficient re-renders

## Conclusion

The T010_AC3 implementation has **LOW** rollback risk due to:

✅ **Additive Nature:** No existing code modified  
✅ **Fallback Available:** Original components remain functional  
✅ **No Breaking Changes:** All existing workflows preserved  
✅ **Quick Recovery:** Simple file removal for complete rollback  
✅ **Data Safety:** No risk to user data or database integrity  

The implementation follows established patterns and includes comprehensive error handling, making production issues unlikely. If rollback is needed, it can be executed quickly without service disruption.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy with feature flag enabled for testing
2. Monitor key metrics for 24-48 hours
3. Gradually enable for broader user base
4. Remove feature flag after stable operation confirmed
