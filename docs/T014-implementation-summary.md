- Proper focus management on modal open/close
- Semantic HTML structure with role attributes

#### ✅ AC7: Rate limiting feedback provides clear user guidance and remaining attempts display
**Enhanced Rate Limiting:**
- Real-time countdown timer for lockout periods
- Detailed rate limit information display
- Multi-language error pattern parsing
- Visual progress indicators for security restrictions
- Clear guidance on next steps and time remaining
- Progressive feedback escalation based on attempt count

## Architecture Overview

### Token Management Architecture
```
TokenManager (Singleton)
├── localStorage Integration
├── Background Refresh Scheduler
├── Event-Driven Notifications
├── Automatic Cleanup
└── API Integration

ProjectStore (Enhanced)
├── Token Manager Integration  
├── Legacy Support
├── Event Listeners
├── Utility Methods
└── Backward Compatibility
```

### Security Features
- 24-hour access token expiration
- 7-day refresh token expiration  
- Automatic token rotation on refresh
- Secure token storage with expiration checking
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### Accessibility Features
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant modal implementation
- Complete keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with ARIA labels
- Focus trap with proper element management
- Live region announcements for dynamic content
- High contrast support and semantic structure

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
1. `/src/services/tokenManager.ts` - Core token management service
2. `/src/components/auth/ProjectRouteGuard.tsx` - Route protection component

### Files Enhanced  
1. `/src/stores/projects.store.ts` - Token lifecycle integration
2. `/src/components/projects/ProjectPasswordModal.tsx` - Accessibility & rate limiting
3. `/src/types/project.ts` - Enhanced types for refresh tokens
4. `/src/app/projects/[id]/layout.tsx` - Route protection implementation

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
If critical issues are discovered:

1. **Revert Project Store Changes:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/stores/projects.store.ts
```

2. **Revert Modal Changes:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/components/projects/ProjectPasswordModal.tsx
```

3. **Remove New Files:**
```bash
rm apps/web/src/services/tokenManager.ts
rm apps/web/src/components/auth/ProjectRouteGuard.tsx
```

4. **Revert Layout:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- apps/web/src/app/projects/[id]/layout.tsx
```

### Gradual Rollback (Component-by-component)

#### Level 1: Disable Route Protection Only
- Remove `ProjectRouteGuard` usage in layouts
- Keep token management active
- Minimal impact on existing functionality

#### Level 2: Disable Token Management
- Comment out `tokenManager` imports in project store
- Fallback to legacy Map-based token storage
- Keep accessibility improvements

#### Level 3: Complete Rollback
- Revert all files to previous versions
- Remove new service files
- Restore original modal implementation

### Testing Rollback Points

1. **Basic Project Access:** Users can access password-protected projects
2. **Token Persistence:** Tokens survive page refresh
3. **Modal Accessibility:** Screen readers can navigate the modal
4. **Rate Limiting:** Security restrictions work properly

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- Background token refresh eliminates authentication interruptions
- Efficient localStorage usage with cleanup
- Scheduled operations prevent resource leaks
- Event-driven architecture reduces polling

### Monitoring Points
- localStorage storage usage
- Background refresh frequency
- Event listener cleanup
- Modal render performance

## Security Considerations

### Enhanced Security
- Automatic token rotation
- Secure token storage patterns
- Rate limiting with user feedback
- Event-driven security notifications

### Risk Mitigation
- Fallback to legacy token storage
- Graceful degradation on localStorage errors
- Comprehensive error handling
- User notification for security events

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing token Map structure preserved
- Legacy API responses supported
- Gradual migration to new token manager
- No breaking changes to existing workflows

### Data Migration
- Automatic conversion of existing tokens
- Preservation of current user sessions
- Seamless upgrade experience

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases
1. **Token Lifecycle:** Create, use, refresh, expire, cleanup
2. **Route Protection:** Access with/without valid tokens
3. **Accessibility:** Screen reader and keyboard navigation
4. **Rate Limiting:** Attempt limits and lockout periods
5. **Background Refresh:** Automatic token renewal

### Integration Tests
1. Multiple project access scenarios
2. Token expiration edge cases
3. Network failure handling during refresh
4. Modal focus trap behavior
5. Error state recovery

## Deployment Strategy

### Recommended Approach
1. **Deploy with feature flag** (if available)
2. **Monitor error logs** for token-related issues
3. **Test with small user group** before full rollout
4. **Gradual enablement** of advanced features

### Success Metrics
- Zero authentication interruptions
