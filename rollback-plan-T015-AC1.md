# Rollback Plan: T015 AC1 - Progress Input Field with Leaf Task Validation

## Overview
This rollback plan covers the implementation of AC1: Progress input field with percentage validation (0-100%) for leaf tasks only.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
1. `/apps/web/src/components/ui/ProgressInput.tsx` - Main progress input component
2. `/apps/web/src/components/ui/__tests__/ProgressInput.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the component
3. `/apps/web/src/app/progress-demo/page.tsx` - Demo page showcasing the functionality

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `@/lib/utils` (cn function)
- Uses `@heroicons/react/24/outline` (already available)
- No new external dependencies added

## Rollback Steps

### Step 1: Remove New Files
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/kfuruhashi/projects/github/GanttChartWebUI/apps/web

# Remove the main component
rm src/components/ui/ProgressInput.tsx

# Remove the test file
rm src/components/ui/__tests__/ProgressInput.test.tsx

# Remove the demo page
rm src/app/progress-demo/page.tsx
```

### Step 2: Verify No Breaking Changes
The implementation is completely self-contained and doesn't modify any existing components, so no additional cleanup is needed.

### Step 3: Verification Commands
```bash
# Check for any remaining references
grep -r "ProgressInput" src/ || echo "No references found - rollback successful"

# Verify build still works
npm run build

# Verify type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk âœ…
- **Self-contained implementation**: No modifications to existing components
- **No external dependencies**: Uses only existing libraries
- **No database changes**: UI component only
- **No API modifications**: Client-side only

### Verification Points
- [ ] No existing functionality affected
- [ ] No import errors in other components
- [ ] Build process unchanged
- [ ] No breaking changes to type definitions

## Recovery Time
**Estimated Time: < 5 minutes**

The rollback is straightforward as it only involves removing the newly created files.

## Post-Rollback Actions
1. Update task status in project management
2. Document any lessons learned
3. Review implementation approach if re-attempting

## Alternative Rollback (Partial)
If only specific issues need to be addressed:

### Keep Core Component, Remove Demo
```bash
# Keep ProgressInput but remove demo page
rm src/app/progress-demo/page.tsx
```

### Keep Component, Fix Issues
```bash
# Keep files but address specific TypeScript issues
# Edit files as needed rather than full removal
```

- **Implementation Lead**: Claude Code Assistant
- **Review Required**: Development Team Lead
- **Deployment Window**: Any time (non-breaking changes)

## Notes
- This rollback plan covers only AC1 implementation
- Future ACs (AC2-AC7) will have separate rollback plans
- No impact on existing progress functionality in GanttBar component
